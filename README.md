## Database Configuration
To connect to a MySQL database, update the application.properties file with the appropriate database URL, username, and password. The following properties need to be updated:
```
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<DatabaseName>
spring.datasource.username = <userName>
spring.datasource.password = <password>
spring.jpa.show-sql = true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

```

## Data Model

The Job data model is defined in the Job class, which has the following attributes:
<br>

* Doctor
```
id: Long
firstName: String
lastName: String
specialization: String
availableSlots: List<LocalDateTime>
```

* Patient
```
id: Long
firstName: String
lastName: String
email: String
phoneNumber: String

```
 
*Appointment
```
